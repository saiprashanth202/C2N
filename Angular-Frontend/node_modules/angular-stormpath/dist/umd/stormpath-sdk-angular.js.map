See a full list of available properties in {\\@link AbstractControl}.\n *\n * **Set the value**: You can set an initial value for each child control when instantiating\n * the {\\@link FormArray}, or you can set the value programmatically later using the\n * {\\@link FormArray}'s {\\@link AbstractControl.setValue} or {\\@link AbstractControl.patchValue}\n * methods.\n *\n * **Listen to value**: If you want to listen to changes in the value of the array, you can\n * subscribe to the {\\@link FormArray}'s {\\@link AbstractControl.valueChanges} event.  You can also\n * listen to its {\\@link AbstractControl.statusChanges} event to be notified when the validation\n * status is re-calculated.\n *\n * **Add new controls**: You can add new controls to the {\\@link FormArray} dynamically by\n * calling its {\\@link FormArray.push} method.\n *  Ex: `this.form.get('cities').push(new FormControl());`\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/nestedFormArray/nested_form_array_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * * **NgModule**: `ReactiveFormsModule`\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nexport var FormArrayName = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(FormArrayName, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {?} parent\n     * @param {?} validators\n     * @param {?} asyncValidators\n     */\n    function FormArrayName(parent, validators, asyncValidators) {\n        _super.call(this);\n        this._parent = parent;\n        this._validators = validators;\n        this._asyncValidators = asyncValidators;\n    }\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormArrayName.prototype.ngOnInit = function () {\n        this._checkParentType();\n        this.formDirective.addFormArray(this);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormArrayName.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () {\n        if (this.formDirective) {\n            this.formDirective.removeFormArray(this);\n        }\n    };\n    Object.defineProperty(FormArrayName.prototype, \"control\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this.formDirective.getFormArray(this); },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(FormArrayName.prototype, \"formDirective\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () {\n            return this._parent ?

These come in handy when you want to perform validation\n * that considers the value of more than one child control.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * ```\n * const form = new FormGroup({\n *   password: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),\n *   passwordConfirm: new FormControl('', Validators.minLength(2)),\n * }, passwordMatchValidator);\n *\n *\n * function passwordMatchValidator(g: FormGroup) {\n *    return g.get('password').value === g.get('passwordConfirm').value\n *       ? null : {'mismatch': true};\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nexport var FormGroup = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(FormGroup, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {?} controls\n     * @param {?=} validator\n     * @param {?=} asyncValidator\n     */\n    function FormGroup(controls, validator, asyncValidator) {\n        if (validator === void 0) { validator = null; }\n        if (asyncValidator === void 0) { asyncValidator = null; }\n        _super.call(this, validator, asyncValidator);\n        this.controls = controls;\n        this._initObservables();\n        this._setUpControls();\n        this.updateValueAndValidity({ onlySelf: true, emitEvent: false });\n    }\n    /**\n     * Registers a control with the group's list of controls.\n     *\n     * This method does not update value or validity of the control, so for\n     * most cases you'll want to use {\\@link FormGroup.addControl} instead.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.registerControl = function (name, control) {\n        if (this.controls[name])\n            return this.controls[name];\n        this.controls[name] = control;\n        control.setParent(this);\n        control._registerOnCollectionChange(this._onCollectionChange);\n        return control;\n    };\n    /**\n     * Add a control to this group.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.addControl = function (name, control) {\n        this.registerControl(name, control);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Remove a control from this group.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.removeControl = function (name) {\n        if (this.controls[name])\n            this.controls[name]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n        delete (this.controls[name]);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Replace an existing control.\n     * @param {?} name\n     * @param {?} control\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    FormGroup.prototype.setControl = function (name, control) {\n        if (this.controls[name])\n            this.controls[name]._registerOnCollectionChange(function () { });\n        delete (this.controls[name]);\n        if (control)\n            this.registerControl(name, control);\n        this.updateValueAndValidity();\n        this._onCollectionChange();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Check whether there is an enabled control with the given name in the group.\n     *\n     * It will return false for disabled controls.

If used\n * within a parent form, the directive will also register itself with the form as a child\n * control.\n *\n * \\@howToUse\n *\n * This directive can be used by itself or as part of a larger form. All you need is the\n * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\n *\n * It accepts a domain model as an optional {\\@link \\@Input}. If you have a one-way binding\n * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\n * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\n * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to\n * the domain model in your class as well.\n *\n * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {\\@link FormControl} (like\n * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using\n * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`). You can then access the control using the\n * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\n * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a\n * full list of properties directly available in {\\@link AbstractControlDirective}.\n *\n * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n *\n * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\n * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access\n * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\n * `#f=\"ngForm\"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.\n *\n * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n * than the domain model's value on submit.\n *\n * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:\n *\n * * Radio buttons: {\\@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\n * * Selects: {\\@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\n *\n * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n *\n *  \\@stable\n */\nexport var NgModel = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(NgModel, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {?} parent\n     * @param {?} validators\n     * @param {?} asyncValidators\n     * @param {?} valueAccessors\n     */\n    function NgModel(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n        _super.call(this);\n        /** @internal */\n        this._control = new FormControl();\n        /** @internal */\n        this._registered = false;\n        this.update = new EventEmitter();\n        this._parent = parent;\n        this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n        this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n        this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(this, valueAccessors);\n    }\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        this._checkForErrors();\n        if (!this._registered)\n            this._setUpControl();\n        if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\n            this._updateDisabled(changes);\n        }\n        if (isPropertyUpdated(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n            this._updateValue(this.model);\n            this.viewModel = this.model;\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () { this.formDirective && this.formDirective.removeControl(this); };\n    Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"control\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._control; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"path\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () {\n            return this._parent ?
